# Lesson11

Beginning in this session and continuing into the next we will explore the world of microbiome data. We will start with the analysis of 16s rRNA sequences, fresh from the sequencer. We will use the R program `dada2` to create what is commonly called an OTUtable from the sequences. We will then use the R program `phyloseq` to analyze these data. Finally we will explore the functional aspects of these data.
